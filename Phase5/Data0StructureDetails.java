    //Methods of Collection:

    //add() - inserts the specified element to the collection.
    //size() - returns the size of the collection
    // remove()- removes the specified element from the collection
    // iterator() - returns an iterator to access elements of the Collection
    // addAll() - adds all the elements of a specified collection to the collection
    // removeAll() - removes all the elements of the specified collection from the collection
    // clear() - removes all the elements from the collection 


    //List interface :

    //In java the list interface is an ordered collection that allows us to store and access ekements sequentually.
    //  It extends the collection interface.
    //  Since List is an interface, we cannot create objects from it. In order to use functionalities of the List interface, 
    //  we can use thee classes:
    //ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, Stack.


    //Set interface:

    //The set interface of the java collections franework provides the features of the mathematical set in Java.
    //  It extends the collection interface. Unlike the list interface. sets cannot contain duplicate e;ements.
    //  In order to use functionalities of the set interface, we can use these classes:
    //HashSet, LinkedHashSet, EnumSet, TreeSet.
    
    
    //Queue Interface:

    //The queue interface  of the java collections framework provides the functionality of the queue data structure.
    //  It extands the collection framework.
    //  In order to use the functionalities of queue we need to use classes that implements it:
    //ArrayDequeue, LinkedList, PriorityQueue.


    //Map Interface:
    //The map interface of the java collecitons framework provides the functionality of the map data structure.
    //  Since map is an interface, we cannot create objects from it.
    //  In order to use functionalities of the map interface we can use these classes:
    // HashMap, EnumMap, LinkedHashMap, WeakHashMap, TreeMap.
